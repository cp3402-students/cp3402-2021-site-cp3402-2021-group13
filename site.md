For administrators who understand WordPress, they can select topics through the WordPress function and select pages in the corresponding topics. In the page function, they can manage all our WordPress pages, including adding, deleting, and modifying. Select the page to modify to view the page content, modify the content, and then update. When we refresh our site, we will find that the modified content has been successful. We need to distinguish between blogs and web pages. One is text-based and the other is page-based. When our site has problems and needs maintenance, we can also guide the maintained page to another page, modify and maintain it, and then upload the maintained page.
