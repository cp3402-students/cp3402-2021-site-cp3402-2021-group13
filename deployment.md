First of all, the first step we are doing in this project is that we need to consider what kind of functions we want to do and what problems we will face in the future. 

Then, it will communicate with users many times to understand the needs of users. For example, what should be displayed on the homepage of the website, whether users can register an account, whether they can recharge members, and, in this process, it is necessary to communicate with customers many times to avoid various problems encountered later.

In the second step, we decide on the website design. This part is to do the outline design of the website, the database design and the design rules and processes that initially describe each function.

The third step is program development. According to the design and page structure, the background of the website is developed.

The last step is to build a server locally to test whether the website has bugs.
